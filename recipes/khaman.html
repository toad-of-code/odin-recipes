          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Green Chillies</li>
          <li>Curry leaves</li>

          <li>Mustard Seeds</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sift 1 & 1/2 cup besan (160 grams) and 1 tablespoon of sooji (14
          grams) into a large bowl using a sifter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a wire whisk to mix everything together. I would suggest not
          skipping on the sifting, it’s an extra step but make the texture of
          the dhokla better. Set this aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now take another large bowl and to that add:
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup water (240 ml/8 oz)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated white sugar (25 grams)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>
              1 & 1/2 teaspoon ginger and green chili paste (made by crushing an
              inch ginger and 2 green chilies together in a food processor)
            </li>
          </ul>
          Stir with a wire whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then add 1/4 teaspoon turmeric, 1 & 1/2 tablespoons oil (you can use
          any oil, I used avocado oil), and 3/4 teaspoon citric acid. Stir with
          a wire whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the besan and sooji and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>
          You should have a lump free batter which is not super thick but not
          runny either. IF the batter looks too thick, you can add 1 to 2
          tablespoons more water at this point. Cover and let the batter rest
          for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you do this step, make sure your steamer is ready to go. Add 2
          & 1/2 to 3 cups water in your steamer and bring it to boil. The batter
          needs to be steamed immediately after the last step and so it’s
          important for the steamer to be ready. Also grease your steaming pan
          before this step. I used a springform pan which makes it easier to
          unmold the dhokla.<br /><br />After 10 minutes are up, add 1/4
          teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon eno and mix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix until it’s all well combined. You would notice the batter will
          feel light, like it has been filled with air and also become lighter
          in color.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the batter to the greased pan immediately. I have used a
          7.5-inch springform pan here but you can use any pan.
        </li>
        <li>Level the batter using a spatula.</li>
        <li>
          Now, place the pan into the steamer (the water should have been
          boiling by now and ready to go). Cover the steamer with a lid and let
          this steam on medium-high heat for around 15 to 16 minutes. The time
          will vary depending on the intensity of the heat and thickness of the
          steamer.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the khaman is steaming, make the tadka. For the tadka, heat 2
          teaspoons of oil (you can use any oil but I used avocado oil) in a
          small pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add 1/2 teaspoon
          mustard seeds. Let them pop and then add 7 to 8 curry leaves, a sliced
          green chili, stir and then add 1/3 cup (80 ml) water. Then add 1
          teaspoon sugar and a pinch of salt. Stir and remove pan from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          To check if your khaman is done, insert a knife in the center, it
          should come out clean. Carefully remove the pan from the steamer and
          let it sit for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 5 minutes, unmold the dhokla. Since, I used a springform pan the
          sides released easily, then turn the pan upside down to unmold. Since
          the base was greased well, it just slid off easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your khaman has cooled down a little, cut it into pieces. They
          are usually cut into squares.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the cooled tadka over the cut khaman cubes (use a spoon to do
          this so that tadka is evenly distributed), making sure the water seeps
          in on the sides as well. Garnish with chopped cilantro, freshly grated
          coconut and enjoy!
